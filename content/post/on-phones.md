I've spent the past six months (yes, really, since December of what's technically "last year") searching for the "perfect next phone" now that my iPhone 4S of the past 2.25 years is overdue for an upgrade.

But the truth is, there isn't a single smartphone on the market at the moment that I really like. It's been a good run with the iPhone, but for various reasons I won't go into, I would prefer to move to Android next. Nonetheless, I've researched the leading smartphones online and checked them out in person - both the iPhone 5* and 6 lines, the Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy Note and S5 and S6, Motorola Moto X, LG G3, and HTC One M9 and I don't know what else. I even looked up Windows phones and the Ubuntu phone, albeit more out of personal curiosity than consumer intent.

I am very fortunate to be in a position where price is not a substantial factor, but even when I look for the "best phone that money can buy", nothing strikes a chord. I read the specs and carefully crafted descriptions for smartphones that boast 20-megapixel cameras, integrated cloud storage, better photo sharing experiences, six-inch screens... everything, it seems, except what the phone was designed for, making and receiving calls. And in the case of the mobile phone, actually being portable (in other words, fitting in my pocket)?

On some evenings, I sit on my bed and cradle a LG Env3 VX9200 in my hand. My second, and third, phone -- because it was a phone I actually loved so much that when the two-year contract ended on the first one, I didn't even consider a smartphone, instead opting to get the same model. By that time (early 2011, if I remember correctly), the Env3 was no longer even in active production or distribution, and I didn't even care that my new phone had been sitting in the Verizon stockroom for who knows how long. In fact, the only reason I didn't just continue using the same device is the same reason I'm not just reactivating one of them now, the dreaded loss of battery life over time. 

But as much as I loved the design and fit and keyboard, it's the memories and experiences that make me smile now: the text message inbox only holding up to 400 messages, and having to carefully select which messages to delete. Actually being able to speed-dial with literally one key, not having to go through windows of "Emergency Contacts" or "Favorite Contacts" nonsense. Not having a Facebook app, and updating my Facebook status by texting a specific number (fondly saved as "Facebook Status Update" in my address book). Don't get me wrong, I still love the convenience that a modern smartphone affords, but I cannot ever imagine feeling this strong a nostalgia for my current iPhone when all my data is backed up on one cloud service or another, and I could easily order another iPhone 4S (hardware) on eBay or elsewhere online. 

A phone I loved so much that I not only _kept_ both devices, but brought them both all the way from Maryland to California with me when I moved...

The search continues.
