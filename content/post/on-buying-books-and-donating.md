+++

At the end of 2014, I was reflecting on my year and thinking about ways to optimize my time management, learning, personal finance, and other habits in the coming year.

I realized I have a tendency to buy a lot of books (read [no pun intended]: I rarely walk into a bookstore and leave empty-handed) that I never actually end up reading/finishing. As much as I love accumulating interesting books and supporting local bookstores, I want to be mindful of my spending and also find and leverage opportunities to build more good habits.

So I came up with a simple new year's resolutions:  **for every book purchase I make, I would donate to charity.** [1]

I didn't set amounts, thresholds, or other complex rules. I could define a purchase as "per-book" or "per-order" online / "per-visit" in-store. I could donate $5 or $50. I could donate to any organization, as long as I was reasonably confident that it was going to a good cause.

At first, I started off with [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/) and [Watsi](https://www.watsi.org). I've been fascinated by the idea of micro-lending since I first heard about Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank back in high school, so Kiva was a natural first choice. I especially love how both platforms share the stories of individual people whom you can support, which creates both a feeling of greater transparency and a stronger human connection. (I actually joined the Watsi Universal Fund, but still receive and love receiving emails about whom a donation goes to support!)

Later, especially after the Nepal earthquake, I was interested in finding larger global organizations to support as well. Sites like [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org) have been an invaluable resource in removing one of my biggest mental barriers to making more charitable donations: finding fiscally responsible organizations with meaningful missions that make a real impact on the communities that need it most. While these are probably extreme examples, these [four scam cancer charities](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/business/4-cancer-charities-accused-in-ftc-fraud-case.html?_r=0) are precisely what I hope to avoid.

Needless to say (hopefully), I'm really pleased with how this has been going so far. No, I haven't been going through my booklog (`echo backlog | sed s/back/book/`) any faster â€“ if anything, I spend slightly more time online looking for and learning about interesting, impactful, and inspiring organizations that are doing good around the world. But I truly, deeply hope that making this small tweak to a personal habit will, directly or indirectly, help positively impact somebody else's life.

[1] This is not at all meant to imply that I want to be very frugal and neither buy books nor donate. I actually do the former at about the same rate, but now I regularly do the latter as well. :)
