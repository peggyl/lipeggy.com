  <h1 class="title">On discovering Go</h1>

  <p>Posted 11 July 2015</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For a more inspiring and technically informative account of learning Go, you should check out Audrey Lim&rsquo;s brilliant GopherCon 2015 talk on <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gophercon2015/123565059490">How a Complete Beginner learned Go as her first backend language in 5 weeks</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s followed (but not muted) me on Twitter in recent months has probably seen at least one of my tweets to @srcgraph. A few days ago, I posted two semi-cryptic tweets that I&rsquo;m (finally) going to explain in more detail than anyone else should care about:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t normally do this, but I promise I&#39;ll only say it once: please consider following / trying <a href="https://twitter.com/srcgraph">@srcgraph</a>. I seriously owe them so much.</p>&mdash; Peggy Li (@_peggyli) <a href="https://twitter.com/_peggyli/status/619669834834415620">July 11, 2015</a></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Roughly six months ago, I had the opportunity to meet somebody on the Sourcegraph team, so I did what any curious person would: Google &ldquo;sourcegraph&rdquo; and decide to install <code>srclib</code>. (I have since mostly stopped Googling people / companies.)</p>

<p>Cool, I just need to follow the excellent instructions on <a href="https://srclib.org/install">https://srclib.org/install</a>, at <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib/blob/eb7ef77f0dd949ca8e5fde18becc0b8a34ce11ad/docs/sources/gettingstarted.md">this commit</a> at the time. I already have Go installed, the <code>src</code> CLI installs flawlessly, and now I just need the language toolchains (whatever those are). I know I have Python, Node, Ruby, and Go all installed, so shouldn&rsquo;t have any issues here&hellip; oh wait, installation error?</p>

<p>The error message doesn&rsquo;t make immediate sense to me, so I try the usual things first: rerun the command in case there was a partial or corrupt download. <code>rm -rf</code> the download directory and <em>then</em> rerun again. Rerun from a different directory; maybe I should be in $HOME or $GOPATH, as opposed to whatever my current working directory was. Rerun as root; there&rsquo;s nothing in the output about permission denied, but can&rsquo;t hurt to try? (Note: please don&rsquo;t really blindly <code>sudo</code> run unfamiliar commands.)</p>

<p>This is getting nowhere, so there&rsquo;s probably a more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; issue than my inability to copy-paste and execute a command. Time to take a closer look at the root error itself. (Yes, this is usually a logical first or second step, not fifth.)</p>

<pre><code>~/go/src/github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-go $ go get github.com/golang/gddo/gosrc
../../golang/gddo/gosrc/client.go:118: syntax error: unexpected range, expecting {
../../golang/gddo/gosrc/client.go:119: syntax error: unexpected {, expecting semicolon or newline or }
../../golang/gddo/gosrc/client.go:122: syntax error: unexpected }
../../golang/gddo/gosrc/client.go:123: non-declaration statement outside function body
../../golang/gddo/gosrc/client.go:124: syntax error: unexpected }
</code></pre>

<p>Time to troubleshoot! Much of this probably seems obvious to you (or even me) now, but keep in mind that this was my very first time looking at non-trivial (e.g. print hello world or sum the numbers from 1-10) Go source code, and I&rsquo;d mostly read <em>about</em> Go on Quora and Hacker News. Open the file in vim, and jump to <a href="https://github.com/golang/gddo/blob/4523d2f070c74ef847157e9aa14137376df63964/gosrc/client.go#L118">line 118</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">for range files {
	if err := &lt;-ch; err != nil {
		return err
	}
}
return nil
</code></pre>

<p>As I try to read and understand Go for what I consider the first time, I have two main thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the difference between <code>:=</code> and <code>=</code> anyway? I&rsquo;ve used Python, Java, C, and JavaScript and <em>tiny</em> amounts of Ruby and Perl once upon a time, so = seems obvious. But what is :=? It looks like it&rsquo;s being used in a similar manner to =, so what&rsquo;s the difference? (Answer: short variable declarations)</li>
</ul>

<p>And more strangely&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the developer checking for an error almost every other line? Is this code actually even reliable, or should I just be expecting it to fail? (Answer: the code is perfectly fine and consistent with Go&rsquo;s error handling philosophy.)</li>
</ul>

<p>My inclination is to give the benefit of the doubt; surely code in a widely-used open-source project wouldn&rsquo;t contain a clear syntax bug, or it would have been reported and fixed already? No matter how silly a logical error there might be, I&rsquo;m confident that the developer would at least make sure the code <em>compiles</em> at all. But I do quickly check for missing/extra opening or closing braces or parentheses; all good.</p>

<p>I comment out lines 92 - 117 and rerun; nope, the error persists, but at least I&rsquo;ve eliminated that (relatively) giant block, which is good. Since this loop uses both <code>ch</code> and <code>files</code>, I think I can assume those are both well-formed, but I&rsquo;ll throw in a couple of print statements to make sure they&rsquo;re not some null/nil value. Also, head to the playground (<a href="http://play.golang.org">play.golang.org</a>) to make sure := and &lt;- are both indeed valid tokens. All good there.</p>

<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an unexpected nil or index-out-of-bounds type issue with the loop causing the body execution to fail? But commenting out lines 119 - 121 doesn&rsquo;t help either, which means that the issue is literally something with <code>for range files</code>. (If you&rsquo;ve been using Go for awhile, you can probably guess by now.)</p>

<p>Completely stumped and almost ready to give up now, I look at <code>git blame</code> and <code>git log</code> as a final resort, to see if there were any potentially suspect recent changes. Aha! All I need to see is this commit message (not even the diff): <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-go/commit/26ec06a07590eb5311019babedaf0b2b31d3c509">go 1.4 support</a></p>

<p>Okay, this is a minor (not micro) version change to the Go language itself, which generally means not full backwards-compatibility. But still, it&rsquo;s a simple <code>for</code> loop! If/else statements and for loops are pretty much the simplest staple control flow structures in most languages, right? But a quick Google search for &ldquo;golang 1.4&rdquo; takes me to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.4">https://blog.golang.org/go1.4</a>, where the third paragraph proudly announces:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The language change is a tweak to the syntax of for-range loops. You may now write &ldquo;for range s {&rdquo; to loop over each item from s, without having to assign the value, loop index, or map key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a slightly sinking feeling, I ran <code>go version</code>&hellip; lo and behold, I&rsquo;m running Go 1.3 (installed back in early or mid December, if I recall correctly; 1.4 was released around the same time). I try uninstalling / deleting my full Go installation and reinstalling a couple of times, to no avail, until I realize <code>brew install go</code> is just still picking up 1.3. Indeed, the only thing I had to do was download and install 1.4 from source. Whew, <em>finally</em>!</p>

<hr />

<p>Let&rsquo;s quickly review (what I consider to be) two central tenets of software development and distribution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Up-to-date documentation (including installation/usage instructions)</li>
<li>Reproducible builds (this often includes some concept of [preferably versioned] package/dependency management)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is why I often say (or at least think) that me &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; Go was a complete fluke, or at least a lucky accident. In a perfect world, the docs would have said 1.4, or the dependent golang/gddo package would be fully backwards-compatible. I would have peacefully installed it and happily moved along, none the wiser about Go. It&rsquo;s entirely possible that, say, had something like <a href="http://getgb.io/"><code>gb</code></a> existed at the time, I would not have really gotten hooked on Go, or at least when I did. (Please make sure you keep your docs and dependencies up-to-date and consistent though!)</p>

<p>Instead, I found myself super intrigued by the handful of lines of code I had looked at.  I was immediately struck by and attacted to how readable, approachable, and clear it was. It certainly helps that I have experience with multiple other languages, but I&rsquo;ve also skimmed tutorials on, say, OCaml and Haskell, where FP principles themselves made sense but the overabundance of non-alphanumeric tokens in code made my head spin. The terse expressiveness of Scala (compared to Java, at least) and syntactic sugar of Ruby are great for developer productivity or just &ldquo;code golf&rdquo;, but also mean that production source code isn&rsquo;t always beginner-friendly. In contrast, Go&rsquo;s fairly concise and straighforward syntax and tools like &ldquo;gofmt&rdquo; that enforce consistency in code style made the language much easier to digest from day one, and I found myself perusing the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">Go Tour</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a>, <a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Go by Example</a>, etc. later that afternoon and weekend.</p>

<p>But&hellip; fast forward to today, and oh, cruel irony! I wanted to include as accurate of an error message as possible, so I decided to install <code>srclib</code> inside a Docker container running the golang:1.3 image. Naturally, I then spent several hours trying to figure out <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/issues/122">this Docker issue</a> and seriously trying to convince myself this is not the universe changing its mind and signaling that I should quit Go and the Go community. (Solution here: forget boot2docker, an AWS instance is only $2.) I really am not making this up.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the last day of GopherCon 2015, I attended the Code of Conduct &amp; Diversity session and called out a prominent member of the Go team (in front of the person himself) for a discouraging comment I had happened to overhear. About half an hour later, I finally gathered the courage to approach someone from Sourcegraph and awkwardly share an abbreviated version of this story. The second conversation was actually <em>by far</em> the scarier of the two, not least because I was essentially saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m basically here today because your documentation was a lie, so thank you for that.&rdquo; I seriously expected to be laughed away or outright dismissed, so the polite incredulity was a better response than I could have hoped for.</p>

<p>So there you have it, the real story of how I got started with Go. Frankly, this isn&rsquo;t something I ever planned on sharing, but the tech community needs more diverse voices. I&rsquo;ve heard many people (predominantly men) talk about how they moved to Go from C, C++, or Ruby for systems programming or to build microservices. I hope that in some tiny way, this brings a more unique perspective to the table.</p>

<p>In a future post, I&rsquo;ll talk more about how the Go community (even more than the language design itself) &ldquo;restored my faith in tech communities.&rdquo;</p>
