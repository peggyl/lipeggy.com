  <h1 class="title">On phones (part 1)</h1>

  <p>Posted 21 June 2015</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past six months (yes, really, since December of what&rsquo;s technically &ldquo;last year&rdquo;) searching for the &ldquo;perfect next phone&rdquo; now that my iPhone 4S of the past 2.25 years is overdue for an upgrade.</p>

<p>But the truth is, there isn&rsquo;t a single smartphone on the market at the moment that I really like. It&rsquo;s been a good run with the iPhone, but for various reasons I won&rsquo;t go into, I would prefer to move to Android next. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve researched the leading smartphones online and checked them out in person - both the iPhone 5* and 6 lines, the Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy Note and S5 and S6, Motorola Moto X, LG G3, and HTC One M9 and I don&rsquo;t know what else. I even looked up Windows phones and the Ubuntu phone, albeit more out of personal curiosity than consumer intent.</p>

<p>I am very fortunate to be in a position where price is not a substantial factor, but even when I look for the &ldquo;best phone that money can buy&rdquo;, nothing strikes a chord. I read the specs and carefully crafted descriptions for smartphones that boast 20-megapixel cameras, integrated cloud storage, better photo sharing experiences, six-inch screens&hellip; everything, it seems, except what the phone was designed for, making and receiving calls. And in the case of the mobile phone, actually being portable (in other words, fitting in my pocket)?</p>

<hr />

<p>On some evenings, I sit on my bed and cradle a LG Env3 VX9200 in my hand. My second, and third, phone &ndash; because it was a phone I actually loved so much that when the two-year contract ended on the first one, I didn&rsquo;t even consider a smartphone, instead opting to get the same model. By that time (early 2011, if I remember correctly), the Env3 was no longer even in active production or distribution, and I didn&rsquo;t even care that my new phone had been sitting in the Verizon stockroom for who knows how long. In fact, the only reason I didn&rsquo;t just continue using the same device is the same reason I&rsquo;m not just reactivating one of them now, the dreaded loss of battery life over time.</p>

<p>But as much as I loved the design and fit and keyboard, it&rsquo;s the memories and experiences that make me smile now: the text message inbox only holding up to 400 messages, and having to carefully select which messages to delete. Actually being able to speed-dial with literally one key, not having to go through windows of &ldquo;Emergency Contacts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Favorite Contacts&rdquo; nonsense. Not having a Facebook app, and updating my Facebook status by texting a specific number (fondly saved as &ldquo;Facebook Status Update&rdquo; in my address book). Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still love the convenience that a modern smartphone affords, but I cannot ever imagine feeling this strong a nostalgia for my current iPhone when all my data is backed up on one cloud service or another, and I could easily order another iPhone 4S (hardware) on eBay or elsewhere online.</p>

<p>A phone I loved so much that I not only <em>kept</em> both devices, but brought them both all the way from Maryland to California with me when I moved&hellip;</p>

<p>The search continues.</p>
