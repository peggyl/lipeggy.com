  <h1 class="title">On buying books and donating</h1>

  <p>Posted 24 May 2015</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>At the end of 2014, I was reflecting on my year and thinking about ways to optimize my time management, learning, personal finance, and other habits in the coming year.</p>

<p>I realized I have a tendency to buy a lot of books (read [no pun intended]: I rarely walk into a bookstore and leave empty-handed) that I never actually end up reading/finishing. As much as I love accumulating interesting books and supporting local bookstores, I want to be mindful of my spending and also find and leverage opportunities to build more good habits.</p>

<p>So I came up with a simple new year&rsquo;s resolutions:  <strong>for every book purchase I make, I would donate to charity.</strong> [1]</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t set amounts, thresholds, or other complex rules. I could define a purchase as &ldquo;per-book&rdquo; or &ldquo;per-order&rdquo; online / &ldquo;per-visit&rdquo; in-store. I could donate $5 or $50. I could donate to any organization, as long as I was reasonably confident that it was going to a good cause.</p>

<p>At first, I started off with <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> and <a href="https://www.watsi.org">Watsi</a>. I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the idea of micro-lending since I first heard about Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank back in high school, so Kiva was a natural first choice. I especially love how both platforms share the stories of individual people whom you can support, which creates both a feeling of greater transparency and a stronger human connection. (I actually joined the Watsi Universal Fund, but still receive and love receiving emails about whom a donation goes to support!)</p>

<p>Later, especially after the Nepal earthquake, I was interested in finding larger global organizations to support as well. Sites like <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org">Charity Navigator</a> have been an invaluable resource in removing one of my biggest mental barriers to making more charitable donations: finding fiscally responsible organizations with meaningful missions that make a real impact on the communities that need it most. While these are probably extreme examples, these <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/business/4-cancer-charities-accused-in-ftc-fraud-case.html?_r=0">four scam cancer charities</a> are precisely what I hope to avoid.</p>

<hr />

<p>Needless to say (hopefully), I&rsquo;m really pleased with how this has been going so far. No, I haven&rsquo;t been going through my booklog (<code>echo backlog | sed s/back/book/</code>) any faster â€“ if anything, I spend slightly more time online looking for and learning about interesting, impactful, and inspiring organizations that are doing good around the world. But I truly, deeply hope that making this small tweak to a personal habit will, directly or indirectly, help positively impact somebody else&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>[1] This is not at all meant to imply that I want to be very frugal and neither buy books nor donate. I actually do the former at about the same rate, but now I regularly do the latter as well. :)</p>
